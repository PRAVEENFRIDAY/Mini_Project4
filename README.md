Skills take away From This Project
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization ,SQL, Streamlit, Machine Learning  (Regression, Classification & Recommendation).

Personalized Recommendations: Suggest attractions based on users' past visits, preferences, and demographic data, improving user experience.
Tourism Analytics: Provide insights into popular attractions and regions, enabling tourism businesses to adjust their offerings accordingly.
Customer Segmentation: Classify users into segments based on their travel behavior, allowing for targeted promotions.
Increasing Customer Retention: By offering personalized recommendations, businesses can boost customer loyalty and retention.
1. Regression: Predicting Attraction Ratings
Aim:
Develop a regression model to predict the rating a user might give to a tourist attraction based on historical data, user demographics, and attraction features.
Use Case:
Travel platforms can use this model to estimate the satisfaction level of users visiting specific attractions. By identifying attractions likely to receive lower ratings, agencies can take corrective actions, such as improving services or better setting user expectations.
Personal travel guides can provide users with attractions most aligned with their preferences to enhance overall satisfaction.
Possible Inputs (Features):
User demographics: Continent, region, country, city.
Visit details: Year, month, mode of visit (e.g., business, family, friends).
Attraction attributes: Type (e.g., beaches, ruins), location, and previous average ratings.
Target:
Predicted rating (on a scale, e.g., 1-5).
2. Classification: User Visit Mode Prediction
Aim:
Create a classification model to predict the mode of visit (e.g., business, family, couples, friends) based on user and attraction data.
Use Case:
Travel platforms can use this model to tailor marketing campaigns. For instance, if a user is predicted to travel with family, family-friendly packages can be promoted.
Hotels and attraction organizers can plan resources (e.g., amenities) better based on predicted visitor types.
Inputs (Features):
User demographics: Continent, region, country, city.
Attraction characteristics: Type, popularity, previous visitor demographics.
Historical visit data: Month, year, previous visit modes.
Target:
Visit mode (categories: Business, Family, Couples, Friends, etc.).
3. Recommendations: Personalized Attraction Suggestions
Objective:
Develop a recommendation system to suggest tourist attractions based on a user's historical preferences and similar users’ preferences.
Use Case:
Travel platforms can implement this system to guide users toward attractions they are most likely to enjoy, increasing user engagement and satisfaction.
Destination management organizations can identify emerging trends and promote attractions that align with user preferences.
Types of Recommendation Approaches:
Collaborative Filtering:
Recommend attractions based on similar users’ ratings and preferences.
Content-Based Filtering:
Suggest attractions similar to those already visited by the user based on features like attraction type, location, and amenities.
Hybrid Systems:
Combine collaborative and content-based methods for enhanced accuracy.
Inputs (Features):
User visit history: Attractions visited, ratings given.
Attraction features: Type, location, popularity.
Similar user data: Travel patterns and preferences.
Output:
Ranked list of recommended attractions.


Approach:
 Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values in the transaction, user, and city datasets.
Resolve discrepancies in city names or other categorical variables like VisitMode, AttractionTypeId, etc.
Standardize date and time format, ensuring consistency across data.
Handle outliers or any incorrect entries in rating or other columns.
Preprocessing:
Feature Engineering:
Encode categorical variables such as VisitMode, Contenent, Country, and AttractionTypeId.
Aggregate user-level features to represent each user's profile (e.g., average ratings per visit mode).
Join relevant data from transaction, user, city, and attraction tables to create a consolidated dataset.
Normalization: Scale numerical features such as Rating for better model convergence.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize user distribution across continents, countries, and regions.
Explore attraction types and their popularity based on user ratings.
Investigate correlation between VisitMode and user demographics to identify patterns.
Analyze distribution of ratings across different attractions and regions.
Model Training:
Regression Task:
Train a model to predict ratings based on user, attractions, transaction features, etc.
Classification Task:
Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest, LightGBM, or XGBoost) to predict VisitMode based on user and transaction features.
Recommendation Task:
Implement collaborative filtering (using user-item matrix) to recommend attractions based on user ratings and preferences.
Alternatively, use content-based filtering based on attractions' attributes (e.g., location, type).
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate classification model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Evaluate regression model using R2, MSE, etc.
Assess recommendation system accuracy using metrics like Mean Average Precision (MAP) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Deployment:
Build a Streamlit app that allows users to input their details (location, preferred visit mode) and receive:
A prediction of their visit mode (Business, Family, etc.).
Recommended attractions based on their profile and transaction history.
Display visualizations of popular attractions, top regions, and user segments in the app.
End Output:
A user-friendly Streamlit application where tourists can input their data and receive personalized recommendations for attractions, as well as get predictions on their likely visit mode.
